          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            As someone that is deeply interested in artistic expression, writing is my favorite medium and one closest to my heart. Having found writing very early on in my life, writing has almost always been a big part of my life as a means of emotional and artistic expression.
            <br><br>
            Writing has always been for me a useful means of self discovery and creativity; a means of creative exploration and maintaining an inner and outward intellectual struggle in pursuit of truth, objectivity and beauty. 
            <br><br>
            I developed an interest in writing in my early teens: keeping a journal, making up stories, and writing dialogue were things that I really enjoyed. Later on, I would have a short career in graphic designing which I really enjoyed for the time it lasted (something that I still enjoy doing) but would eventually move on to wanting to become a writer. Content writing is fun and I'm really good at it. I want to be eventually able to run my own blog/site and write some books about philosophy and if lucky enough, also be a part of an indie movie.

            <p class="fst-italic">
              My content writing journey started in 2019. My first job was for a quite well-established site called Yoreoyster, I wrote for them extensively on a wide range of topics. The position was quite demanding, it required long hours of work (most of which was spent researching/looking for data; sometimes data that wasn't even available on the web which would result in having to reach out to service providers), quick turnarounds, and a very competitive work environment. My time there taught me a lot about teamwork and detailed-oriented research and writing.

              I've also worked as a content manager for <a href="https://dadsagree.com/">DadsAgree</a> and <a href="https://simplybestof.com/">SimplyBestOf</a>. My time there taught me a lot about some of the long-term planning that goes into content creation: the research it requires to form a content strategy and the creativity to utilize it. Looking for and identifying new content opportunities, creating/updating content guidelines, monitoring website traffic, content promotion: managing marketing budgets, updating/improving existing content, and supervising/editing content are just some of the things that go overlooked when we think of the subject of content creation and maintaining a website.

          <h2>Why You Should Hire Me?</h2>
          <p>There are many writers available to be hired so why should you hire me?</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <strong>Creating well-researched, credible content: </strong>The content I'm going to write for you is going to be fun/engaging but also credible: backed by facts and thorough research.
            <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <br>
            <strong>Conveying your voice:</strong>I take the time to learn everything about you and your business to make sure your brand voice is accurately conveyed. Becoming a part of a new project is never easy, that's why I only work with people/companies I find interesting so it's easier for me to learn about them without becoming bored/losing interest.  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Communication and transparency: </strong>Everything works out so smoothly when a client knows exactly what they want and when there's room for discussion, discussing and deciding upon everything beforehand can be a matter of life and death in terms of productivity. Keeping in touch and maintaining proper communication is really important. My process is to decide upon everything in advance via call or chat before the writing process's begun and keep in touch on the off chance that something comes up. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Keeping in touch: </strong>I keep you informed about the work you’ve hired me for and adhere to deadlines. I consider myself a team player and have <strong>the capacity and soft skills to work in a team environment</strong>. As well as retaining enough independence and the capacity to innovate to require minimum supervision. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>In essence: </strong>An extraordinary <strong>audience awareness</strong> and <strong>the ability to influence, persuade</strong> while at the time offering credible content illustrated in an interesting way are just some of the things I bring to the table. 
          </p>
          
          
            
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>Here's a list of some of the things I can do for you.</p>
          <br>
          <p> 
            <strong>SEO Optimization:</strong> I write content that’s SEO-friendly (without using any cookie-cutting,
            keyword stuffing / negative SEO practices).
            I am a firm believer in naturally optimizing my work and it’s something that’s always worked for me. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Research:</strong> Researching a subject of writing functions as the initial stage of becoming familiar with it. In addition, the data we're able to collect during this stage of the writing ends up being the backbone of our content. I use my time-tested research skills to find data that's relevant to my subject of writing. The content I'll write for you is going to be smoothly worded and informative. Offering reliable information in an interesting way is something I consider an important aspect of my writing.  </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Editing and Revisions:</strong> Once I'm done with the writing part of the process, I continue to go over my work multiple times to make suer that everything's in order.
              I start off with general proofreading to eliminate any stupid mistakes (such as typos, punctuation erorrs etc. )
              that may be floating out there and continue to line editing to improve the general readability and flow of the content; ensuring adherence to client's style guide, tone and voice of content.
              And a final overview to ensure appropriate use of targeted keywords, fact checking, proper citation/sourcing, presence of relevant internal and external links etc.
              This helps ensure I offer content that's ready to publish upon submission, saving both myself and my client a lot of time.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <strong>Keyword Research:</strong> A big part of being a content manager is keyword research. Finding a
              good keyword is a quest that’s rarely straightforward, something that requires counter intuitive thinking and creativity. Searching for keywords, performing keyword analysis,
              analyzing the keywords competitors are ranking for,
              narrowing down a list of seed keywords, extracting a list of more specified long tail keywords to tackle are just some of the aspects of keyword research that any good keyword researcher must be closely familiar with.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <strong>Graphic Designing: </strong>  Although I’m not a professional graphic designer, graphic designing is something
              that I really enjoy doing. If there’s a subject I’m interested in after writing,
              it’s communicating through color/sensory visual cues. Even to my writing,
              I would say, there is a certain visual aspect that’s kind of hard to ignore.

          <h2>Services and Rates</h2>
          <p>
            I specialize in writing relatively long-form content that’s engaging and informative.
            My goal when writing is to create content that’s fun to read and interesting but also reliable and authoritative. All the content I produce is SEO friendly
            and backed by thorough research. I use my experience with SEO-optimized content
            and familiarity with the best SEO principles and practices to give you the best chance at ranking higher.      
            <br><br>
            The content I produce is edited and reedited multiple times, making sure everything's in order and the work's according to your idea of how it should be; the right ideas are being effective communicated in right tone and voice; making sure all the links and graphics are in order and the piece on the whole makes for a smooth read. This saves us a lot of time with the often entirely unnecessary post-submission steps. 
            <br><br>
            When you hire me, you'll be working with me and me alone. I do not outsource any of my work and the work I do do, I do with incredible care and attention; I love writing and maintaining a healthy relationship with my clients is something I benefit from. 

            My freelance content writing rates are based on approximate length of the project, the amount of research it requires and your required turnaround time. We shall decide upon a price that's fair to the both us upfront, so that both parties may proceed with their hearts at ease and their minds entirely focused on getting things done.
            
            <br><br>

            Please make sure to remember that I do not charge a per word/per hour fee, something that I believe isn't fair to either of us. It's manner of doing business that creates certain hindrance that I find very hard to work with. I believe in writing good content and charging a fair price for it regardless of how many words it takes to get there. Keeping of every word or every minute of every hour works for some writers but in my case, my creativity struggles with it.
